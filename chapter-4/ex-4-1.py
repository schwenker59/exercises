# Initialize variables for bugs collected and total bugs.
# be sure to initialize them as integers


# Get the number of bugs collected from the user
# use a for loop to get the number of bugs exactly five times, once for each day


	# input bugs collected on this day and convert it to an int

    
    # add bugs collected to total bugs


# Display the total number of bugs collected for all five days.
