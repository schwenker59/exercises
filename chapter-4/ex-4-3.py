# Programming Exercise 4-3
#
# Program to check whether spending was within budget.
# This program prompts a user for a budget and amounts of money spent during a month,
# totals the spending and compares it to the budget,
# then displays the results, stating whether spending was within or over budget. 

# Declare variables to store amount spent, budget, total spent, and difference.
# initialize all variables as floats

    
# Get the budget from the user and cast it to a float.


# Use a while loop to get the amounts spent from the user and add them to total spent
# A while loop is preferred because we don't know how many amounts the user will enter.
# End the while loop when the user enters 0 for an amount spent.
# Note: the loop will not run if the amount spent is already zero, so set it to -1.
# 
# while amount spent is not equal to 0 ...

	# prompt the user for the amount spent and cast it to a float

    # add the amount spent to the total spent



# outside the loop, set the difference to hold budget - total spent

# Display a message with the total spent formatted to two decimal places


# if over budget, display a message with the difference formatted to two places.

# else if under budget, display a message with the difference formatted to two places.

# else display message stating that spending and budget were equal.
