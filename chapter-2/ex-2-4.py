# Program to compute a final price for five items with tax.
# This program will prompt a user for a set of five prices,
# sum them to a subtotal and calculate sales tax with tax rate stored in a constant,
# then display the results on the screen.

# Variables to hold the prices of five items, the subtotal, and the total.
# All should be initialized as floats.


# Constant for the sales tax rate.


# Get the price of each item by prompting the user.
# You will need to convert each input to a float.


# Calculate the subtotal by adding up the item prices.


# Calculate the sales tax by multiplying the subtotal by the tax rate.
