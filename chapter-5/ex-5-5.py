# Programming Exercise 5-5
#
# Program to compute assessed value and property tax.
# This program accepts a property value from a user,
# uses global constants to calculate an assessed value and property tax,
# then passes them to a function to display the results for the user.



# Global constants for assessment percentage and property tax rate



# define the main function

    # Define local float variables for property value, assessed value and property tax


    # Get the property value from the user.


    # Calculate the assessed value using the global constant


    # Calculate the property tax using the global constant


    # Call the function to display property tax information, 
    # passing assessed value and property tax as arguments


    
# Define a function to display property tax information.
# This function accepts the assessed value and property tax as parameters,
# performs no calculations,
# but displays the information with float variables formatted to 2 decimal places.

	# display the assessed value
	
	# display the property tax



# Call the main function to begin the program.
