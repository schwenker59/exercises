# Programming Exercise 5-14
#
# Program to compute kinetic energy from mass and velocity.
# This program accepts values for mass and velocity from the user in kilograms and meters per second,
# passes them to a function that returns kinetic energy in joules calculated from those values,
# and displays the result.


# define the main function

    # define local float variables for mass, velocity and kinetic energy


    # Get mass from user


    # Get velocity from user


    # Get kinetic energy in joules from the kinetic energy function


    # Display kinetic energy in joules, formatted to 2 decimal places.



# Define a function to calculate kinetic energy in joules.
# The function accepts two parameters, mass in kilograms and velocity in meters/second,
# uses a formula to calculate the joules of kinetic energy,
# and returns the result

    # Define a local variable for joules of kinetic energy

	# calculate the kinetic energy using the parameters and the conversion formula    

	# return the result



# Call the main function to start the program
