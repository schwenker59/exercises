# Programming Exercise 6-2
#
# Program to read up to five lines of a file and display them.
# This program prompts the user for a file name,
# attempts to open and read five lines of the file,
# then displays those lines and finally closes the file.



# define a main function

    # Declare local variables, line and filename as strings and counter as int
    
    # Prompt the user for a file name

    # Open the specified file for reading

    # Read the first line of the file and increment the line counter to 1
    # this is needed to prepare conditions for the while loop to follow

    
    # Use a while loop to read until counter is 5 or reading produces no data

	# remove carriage returns before display, as print() supplies its own

        # print the current line

        # read the next line

        # Update counter when line is read


    # Close file


# Call the main function to begin the program
