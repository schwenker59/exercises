# Programming Exercise 6-6
#
# Program to find the average value of numbers stored in a text file.
# This program takes no user input but requires a file with one number per line,
# which it opens, loops through totaling the values, then averages them,
# and displays the average value on the screen.

# Define the main function

    # Declare local float variables for number and total, and an integer counter

    
    # Open numbers.txt file for reading

    # Iterate over the lines in the file

        # increment the counter

        # get a number from the current line

        # add the number to the total

        
    # Close file


    # Calculate average

    
    # Display the average of the numbers in the file



# Call the main function to start the program
